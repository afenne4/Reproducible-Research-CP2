# Reproducible Research-Economic and Public Health Consequences of Severe Weather Events
For this project, data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database
was obtained and used to answer the questions of what severe weather events cause the most damage in relation
to the economy and public health. There are almost 1 million observations across 37 variables (columns) in the dataset.

## Variables of interest
Of the 37 variables there are only 8 variables that are of interest for this analysis.
  
  -Date: A character string with the date in the format of MM/DD/YYYY with meaningless time
  (there is another variable that records the actual time) in the format of H:MM:SS
  
  -EVTYPE: A character string with labels for each severe weather event occurred. There are 48
  official event types ([Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)) but due to data entry discrepancies, there are many more unique instances
  than this. Details for how this was addressed are located in the .Rmd and .pdf files.
  
  -Fatalities: A numeric variable with counts of deaths resulting from a weather event.
  
  -Injuries: A numeric variable with counts of injuries resulting from a weather event.
  
  -PropDmg:A numeric variable containing information about the amount of property damage a 
  weather event cause (in USD)
  
  -PropDmgExp: A character variable that
