Second course project for Coursera course Rep Research Analysis uses NOAA data


In this report we examine the economic and public health consequences of severe weather events. 
The data is obtained from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. 
The data includes records from 1950-2011 which contain information such as where and when the weather events
occur as well as information on fatalities, injuries, and property damage. We narrowed our search to include 
the years between 1996-2011 as this was when all the currently available weather events were recorded. Based 
on this time window, tornadoes were the most dangerous weather event in relation to public health followed by
excessive heat and floods. In relation to the economic consequences, hurricanes and flooding were the most 
costly weather events, followed by flash floods and hail.
